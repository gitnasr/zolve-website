# Cloudflare Workers

Cloudflare Workers provide a **powerful and flexible** way to use free, open-source LLMs with a single API key. With models like **Deepseek, Llama**, and more, you can now integrate Cloudflare Workers directly into Zolve for exam solving.

### What Do You Need to Configure It?

#### 1. A Cloudflare Account
- Sign up for a free Cloudflare account [here](https://cloudflare.com).

#### 2. Generate API Credentials
- Navigate to `ai/workers-ai/api-quick-start` from the Cloudflare sidebar.
- **Copy your Account ID** (the first item displayed).
- Click on **Create a Workers AI API Token**.
- In the sidebar that appears, click **Create API Token**.
- You'll be redirected to a page containing your **API Token**. **Copy and save it immediately**, as you won't be able to view it again.

#### 3. Choose a Model
- Go to the [Workers AI Catalog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) and filter by **Text Generation**.
- Select a model (e.g., **deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b**).
- On the modelâ€™s page, locate the **Model ID** (it starts with `@cf`). **Copy it**.
